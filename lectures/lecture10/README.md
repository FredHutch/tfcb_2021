# Lecture 10: Python data analysis with pandas and scikit-learn

This final section on Python will provide more depth to your understanding of the Python packages widely used for statistical and data analysis: pandas, numpy and scikit-learn (all of which come installed with Anaconda!).

## Learning objectives

- Apply functions from `numpy` to manipulate multidimensional numeric data
- Import, manipulate, and visualize data with pandas
- Understand and apply common methods in machine learning using scikit-learn

## Class materials

- The content for this lecture is containing in the Jupyter notebook [`lectures10and11.ipynb`](lectures10and11.ipynb) located in this directory.

- We recommend making a copy of that notebook (naming it something different, like `my_lectures10and11.ipynb`), to prevent conflicts when pulling any changes for the next lecture.
