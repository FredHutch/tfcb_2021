    "# Python is a powerful, expressive, and easy to learn programming language. It is widely used in computational biology. There are a wealth of packages (numpy, scipy, pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn) for data analysis in python. So it's **totally** worth learning!\n",

    "* There are two modes: *command mode* and *edit mode*. \n",

    "* In command mode you can move up and down between cells, add and delete cells, switch a cell's *type* between code and markdown, etc. \n",
    "* To enter command mode, hit `Esc` (the Escape key).\n",
    "* to enter edit mode with the selected cell (the one with the blue border or bar on the left-hand side), hit `Enter`. The border color will change to green (viewed in a browser, or become blue in vscode).\n",
    "* To run (execute) a cell (or selected cells), type `Ctrl-Enter`. `Shift-Enter` will run the current cell and select the next one.\n",
    "* To see the other keyboard shortcuts, click on the `Help` menu.\n",
    "* If you get stuck executing an infinite loop, choose `Interrupt` from the `Kernel` menu. \n",
    "* If you are in command mode, hitting the `a` key will add a new cell above the currently selected cell; `b` will add a new cell below the current cell.\n"

    "* `csv`: routines for reading/writing delimitted data\n",
    "* `sys`: special variables used or maintained by the interpreter (`sys.path`, `sys.stdout`, `sys.argv`, ...)\n",
    "* `random`: random number generators\n",
    "* `glob`: file-finding functions with wild-cards (like using `*` on the command line)\n",
    "* `pdb`: python debugger\n",
    "* `timeit`: for profiling (timing) code snippets\n",
