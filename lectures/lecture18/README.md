# Lecture 18: Remote computing

This last session will begin to tie together principles for you, as we explore how to work with genomic data using remote computing. We'll be learning more about data management, as well as working with command-line bioinformatics software. This material represents how you would work with newly derived sequencing data, prior to the analyses we've previously explored in Bioconductor or Biopython.

## Learning objectives

After this session, you should be able to:
- run command-line genomics software
- understand the development of simple pipelines involving command-line genomics software

## Class materials

- The course materials are contained in the file [`lecture18.md`](lecture18.md).
- You should log into Rhino using the [class instructions](https://fredhutchio.github.io/tfcb_2020/software/unix_rhino) we used earilier in the quarter.
