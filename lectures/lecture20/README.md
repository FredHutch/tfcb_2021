You'll have this class period to work on your capstone activity. The instructions are available [here](https://github.com/fredhutch/tfcb_2019/tree/master/homeworks/homework08). We recommend selecting a dataset prior to the class meeting so you can receive feedback in class about the scope of your research questions.
