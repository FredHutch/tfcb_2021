# Phil is going to update this homework based on how the first python classes go; stay tuned. It will be ready by Thursday Oct 21, end of day.

If you have difficulty viewing this notebook in GitHub, copy the URL to the page and paste it into [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) to render.

This assignment uses output from a genomic analysis. Because the instructions for each question describe the desired output in relation to the specific data provided, you should not need a deep understanding of the specific data to complete the assigned exercises.

**Instructions:**
- Update your clone of the class website on your computer.
- Navigate to the `homeworks/homework03` directory, launch the notebook (`ipynb` file), and add your code to answer each question. Please note that your notebook needs to access the `data` directory in the class repository in order for the included code to run.
- Take advantage of the code chunks included at the bottom of the page!
- Make sure your entire notebook is executable, and has been executed in order (in the "Cell" menu, select "Run All")
